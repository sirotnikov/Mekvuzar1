This archive is an Eclipse project for writing the parallel version of GameOfLife. 
The project contains a working serial implementation, as well as the framework 
which evaluates the correctness of the parallel implementation. 

You should implement method "invoke" in the class ParallelGameOfLife.java. 
It is invoked with the parameters as provided to the program in the command line, and its results
are compared with those of the serial version. If the comparison succeeds -> your parallel implementation
works correctly. Otherwise your implementation is incorrect. 
The data structures in the evaluation framework SHOULD NOT be considered as a hint
for the way to implement the parallel version. 

Two test files of inital pattern are provided. These files are in Life1.05 format, and there are plenty of verious files
can be found all over the internet. In particular, you can download many of them from the site:

For convenience,  a jar file GameOfLife.jar is provided,  which allows to view the game field and its development 
from generation to generation given some initial pattern. I do not guarantee the correctness of the implementation. 
Furthermore, large fields are likely to be distorted since the size of the field plays a crucial role.
To invoke it issue the command: java -jar GameOfLife.jar. It can read all the patter files in Life1.05 formats, but it 
ignores the inital coordinates, so beware of consequencies.

To summarize, the program correctness is validated solely by comparing the output with that 
of the provided serial implementation.
